Adapter vs Proxy - Both are mostly same, except that proxy has three types - virtual, remote and privacy.
While adapter is used to mimic the behaviour of an incompatible but usable interface, proxy is used to mimic
functionality in the above mentioned use cases.

Bridge vs Strategy - Bridge is creational pattern while strategy is behavioural. Intent of bridge pattern is to split up a monolith two different hierarchies.
Strategy is used to plug in different implementations of the composed class at run time which can be done by bridge as well but strategy is more related to
changing behaviour at run time based on input.
